# Hello, welcome to the project!
**Meaningify** is a chrome extension that will help you get the meaning of any word by just one-click. Whether you are reading a book online or accessing any web page, you don't need to open google to search for the meaning of meaning of the word.<br>

Since I was facing this issue while reading books online, I have to keep my phone aside for searching word meaning simultaneously so I thought of making an extension of my own for tackling this thingðŸ˜‰<br>
## Steps to access it in your system
Since, it's not been published in the chrome web store yet, so if u wan't to use it, you have to install it in your local system.
